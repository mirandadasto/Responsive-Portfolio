                        Hello, my name is Miranda D'Asto.
                        I am currently working on my bachelors for IT management. 
                        I am on track to graduate in April of 2021. In the meantime, I am
                        taking a course in coding and full-stack web development
                        offered by the University of Utah to supplement my education. 
                        My life can get a little crazy as I have a full-time job and am
                        attending two different schools. I can honestly say I'm never bored!
                        <br> <br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy going to my studio where I train on
                        aerial apparatuses such as hammock, lyra (hoop), and silks.
                        I have a performance in February that I train for in the evenings
                        and on the weekends. There is never a free moment, but six months
                        from now, I'll be so very happy I did what I did! I 
                        have also started taking horse back riding lessons (again) on 
                        the weekends. I lead an exciting life full of education and
                        adventure! I am very happy where I am, but so very excited for my
                        future. 
                        </p>
